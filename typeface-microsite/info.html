    <h1>Info Page</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">This typeface is inspired by witches and spiders, incorporating unique serifs modeled after sharp witch nails, hats, and spider threads. Rather than repeating a single decorative element, the letterforms feature a variety of thorn-like details, making each character feel distinct yet cohesive. This approach ensures that the typeface maintains a dynamic and organic appearance, avoiding monotonous repetition. To complement this eerie yet stylish aesthetic, the dingbats🦇 for this typeface are designed as bats. The sharp edges of the bats echo the thorny details found throughout the letterforms, reinforcing a sense of visual harmony and thematic unity.
        Designed with a bold weight, this typeface is intended for use in horror movie posters that are serious but not overly dark. Its striking presence makes it perfect for media that balances horror with a sense of playfulness or theatricality. However, this typeface is not limited to horror or thriller themes—it can be used effectively wherever bold energy and a sharp, dramatic atmosphere are required. It is particularly well-suited for eye-catching posters, large-scale billboards, and even body text in books with eerie, gothic, or grotesque themes. Its versatility allows it to stand out in both commercial and artistic applications, making it an excellent choice for multiple projects.</p>
