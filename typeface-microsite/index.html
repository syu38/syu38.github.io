    <p class="bodytext">This typeface is inspired by witches and spiders, incorporating unique serifs modeled after sharp witch nails, hats, and spider threads. Rather than repeating a single decorative element, the letterforms feature a variety of thorn-like details, making each character feel distinct yet cohesive. This approach ensures that the typeface maintains a dynamic and organic appearance, avoiding monotonous repetition. To complement this eerie yet stylish aesthetic, the dingbats for this typeface are designed as bats. The sharp edges of the bats echo the thorny details found throughout the letterforms, reinforcing a sense of visual harmony and thematic unity.</p>
